# Collected Quotes of Jeff Bezos  

## Innovation  
- **One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves. You don't choose your passions. Your passions choose you.**  
- **If you double the number of experiments you do per year, you're going to double your inventiveness.**  
- You have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.  
- Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment.  
- We innovate by starting with the customer and working backwards. That becomes the touchstone for how we invent.  

## Leadership  
- **We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details.**

## Time & Decisions  
- **Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.**  
- Where you are going to spend your time and your energy is one of the most important decisions you get to make in life.  
- **If I have three good decisions a day, that's enough. They should just be as high quality as I can make them.**  
- People who are right most of the time are people who change their minds often.  
- If you're long-term oriented, customer interests and shareholder interests are aligned.  

## Customer Service
